# passwordGenerator

This project was to test the understanding of basic javascript skills. This project was to take starter code and modify it so that the password generator works correctly and displays the
correct values to the screen. The user can choose from [lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters].

# Usage

To use the password generator, click the "generate password" button and you will be prompted with multiple messages asking what characters you would like to have in your new password.
The generator will then spit out a string of random characters that you chose from as your new password. If you would like create another password, refresh the page and answer the prompts
again.
